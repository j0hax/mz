`mz` is a command-line mensa browser.

The name `mz` is inspired by my German coworkers' [greetings for lunch](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahlzeit#%E2%80%9EMahlzeit%E2%80%9C_als_Gru%C3%9F).

**Please Note:** `mz` is under active development. Not all features may be complete and the program may undergo big changes in the future.
